# Computer-Vision-CNN-Image-Classification
You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. The project is from a dataset from Kaggle.

For the purposes of this project only Train data is used. As the test dataset is not labeled, we wonâ€™t be able to calculate the accuracy score. So only used train images and train labels to split further into training and testing set during the model building.
